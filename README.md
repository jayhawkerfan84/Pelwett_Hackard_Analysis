# Pelwett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the new analysis was to provide two deliverables for comany Pewlett Hackard. One deliverable was 

the total number of positions of people who are about to or close to retirement age. The other deliverable was to provide 

a spreadsheet that contains people that are senior and who be eligible for mentoring new hires. 

## Results

  - This company a lot of positions that are about to be open
  - Many of the positions are senior level
  - There is good representation of senior engineers in the mentorship list
  - The mentorship is small compared to the retiring position count

## Summary

I think the thing that bothered me the most about this exercise was the one to many relationship between employment number and title. 

I would like to have a title table where with a primary key for each title. Then you could have a 1 to 1 relationship between employee and title.

For further analysis you could join the salaries table to see the total salary of people retiring.
